# Anything AI: Segment Anything meets Stable Diffusion, in your browser.

Click and fill anything in your image, with a simple text prompt.

[anything-ai.com](https://www.anything-ai.com/) is a creative photo editing tool that accepts an image, creates object masks (holes) based on where you click in the image, and then generates content to magically fill the hole with whatever you want. 

*Anything* is based on recent research efforts in image inpainting, particularly [Inpaint Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06790). Image segmentation is powered by Meta's [Segment-Anything Model (SAM)](https://segment-anything.com/) and content generation is powered by [Stable Diffusion Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752).
